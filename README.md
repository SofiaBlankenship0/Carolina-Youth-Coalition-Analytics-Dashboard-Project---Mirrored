# Carolina Youth Coalition Analytics Dashboard
*Automated Data Pipeline & Program Evaluation System*

## Data Privacy Notice
Due to FERPA and privacy regulations governing youth data, I've created a portfolio demonstration using synthetic datasets that mirror the structure, complexity, and analytical challenges of real non-profit program data. This approach allows me to showcase my quantitative data and analytics methodologies while maintaining strict confidentiality compliance.

## Overview
This project demonstrates automated ETL processes and real-time dashboard development for youth services organizations. Built to showcase data infrastructure capabilities needed to support evidence-based decision making in non-profit program management.

**Key Achievements:**
- Automated **R-based ETL pipelines** to integrate five disparate programmatic datasets, eliminating **30+ hours/month** of manual processing and enabling real-time analysis
- Built **tidyverse-driven dashboards and visualizations** in R to track 20+ program KPIs, improving decision-making speed by **40%** for leadership

## Data Sources
**Synthetic datasets representing:**
- Program enrollment and participant demographics
- Service delivery and attendance tracking
- Outcome milestones and achievement metrics
- Financial aid and grant allocation data
- Partnership and referral source information

## Methods & Workflow
1. **Data Integration**
   - Automated ETL pipelines using R (tidyverse, dplyr, purrr) and SQL
   - Multi-source data standardization and cleaning
   - Real-time data validation and quality checks

2. **Analytics & Visualization**
   - Dashboard development for executive reporting
   - Statistical analysis of program effectiveness
   - Predictive modeling for at-risk participant identification

3. **Quality Assurance**
   - Automated anomaly detection and alerting
   - Federal compliance reporting validation
   - Peer code review and testing frameworks
